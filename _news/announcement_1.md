I am currently taking MGED11, STAB52, MATB41, MATB44, STAB40, CSCC37. In order: Theory and Practice of Regression Analysis, An Introduction to Probability (mathematical treatment), Techniques of the Calculus of Several Variables I, Differential Equation I, Fundemental of Investment and Credit, and Introduction to Numerical Methods. See my [blog](https://eric-ideas.github.io/blog/) named [introspection] for my academic journal. I update what I learned and some of my remarks or thoughts each week.
