In high school, I was introduced to the `history of economic thought`. From there, I began my reading in philosophy and political economy. In my freshman year, I was indecisive about a discipline of focus. I tried philosophy, political science, economics, etc. Then, there was this philosophy class named Puzzle and Paradox, offered in Winter 2024 by Prof. Andrew Lee, that ignited my passion for `analytic writing`. Such writing apprehends that which is certain with explicit axioms. To me, this is when knowledge and understanding are systematically optimized. My exposure to such clarity and logic-emphasized ways of analysis has also influenced my economic stance. I came to appreciate the analytic methodology employed by modern economics — in particular, that of Dr. Gary Becker’s style on household microeconomics.

I aspire to become an `economist`. Economics is where my intellectual curiosity began. In the second year of my undergrad, I committed my second area of study to a mathematics specialist — statistics stream — alongside my economics major. There, I began to `LaTeX` all of my notes and received positive feedback from my peers. The notes can now be accessed on the gallery page. I have also included some of my vibe-coded visualizations of (mostly) famous results in courses I have taken. The projects page consists of some papers I wrote for my classes and edited after submission. You can find some of my teaching material (used in private tutorials) on the teaching page.
