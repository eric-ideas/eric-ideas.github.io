In high school, I was introduced to the <span style="color: rgb(184, 229, 248);">history of economic thought</span>. From there, I began my reading in philosophy and political economy. In my freshman year, I was indecisive about a discipline of focus. I tried philosophy, political science, economics, etc. Then, there was this philosophy class named Puzzle and Paradox, offered in Winter 2024 by Prof. Andrew Lee, that ignited my passion for <span style="color: rgb(255, 188, 134);">analytic writing</span>. 

Such writing apprehends that which is certain with explicit axioms. To me, this is when knowledge and understanding are systematically optimized: reasonings subjected to <span style="color: rgb(255, 188, 134);"> minimal "belifs" <span> that accounts for gaps and leaps in arguments. My exposure to such clarity and logic-emphasized ways of analysis has also influenced my <span style="color: rgb(255, 188, 134);"> economic stance.<span> I come to appreciate the analytic methodology employed by modern economics — in particular, that of <span style="color: rgb(184, 229, 248);"> Dr. Gary Becker’s style on household microeconomics <span>. 

I aspire to become an <span style="color: rgb(184, 229, 248);">economist</span>. Economics is where my intellectual curiosity began. In the second year of my undergrad, I committed my second area of study to a mathematics specialist — statistics stream — alongside my economics major. There, I began to <span style="color: rgb(255, 188, 134);">LaTeX</span> all of my notes and received positive feedback from my peers. The notes can now be accessed on the [gallery](https://eric-ideas.github.io/gallery/) page. On this page you can also find some of my <span style="color: rgb(184, 229, 248);">vibe-coded visualizations</span> of (mostly) famous results in courses I have taken. The [projects](https://eric-ideas.github.io/projects/) page consists of some papers I wrote for my classes and edited after submission. You can find some of my teaching material (used in private tutorials) on the [teaching](https://eric-ideas.github.io/teaching/) page.
